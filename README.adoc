Spring-a-Gram is a demonstration of the Spring stack used to upload and view pictures.

* http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework[Spring MVC]
* http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot]

Spring Data REST makes it incredibly simple to define and export data store entities. What does this mean? You declare
the POJOs that are stored in your database. In this case, we are using a JPA, in-memory data store. (Spring Data
REST supports other data stores as well). You then define a related repository interface. Spring Data REST takes it
from there to create a hypermedia-driven, RESTful interface using Spring MVC that lets you create, read, update, and
delete data.

This sample application demonstrations how declaring a backend aimed at storing image data can make it
as simple as possible to upload pictures and then turn around and display them on a website. This opens
the door to other front ends, like an iOS or Android app.

If you want to run it right now, you need:

* Java 8+
* Maven 3.0+ (http://maven.apache.org)
* Bower 1.3+ (http://bower.io)

To download and run:

. `git clone git@github.com:gregturn/spring-a-gram.git` to grab a local copy (or clone your own fork).
. `bower install` to pull down javascript libraries. If you get prompted about jQuery, accept the version specified in bower.json
. `mvn clean spring-boot:run`

NOTE: To deploy a copy to PWS, you need a Java 8 build pack. Execute `cf push spring-a-gram -p target/spring-a-gram-0.1.0.jar -b https://github.com/spring-io/java-buildpack.git` and you'll be set.

This should get the app started courtesy of Spring Boot. Now you can traverse the app from different view points.

* From the command line, interrogate the API with `curl localhost:8080/api`. Navigate to the other links.
* From the desktop, visit http://localhost:8080 to see the Desktop version of the web experience.
* From a mobile device, visit http://localhost:8080 and see a different flow, optimized for the smaller real estate.

Give it a whirl!
